A frustrating co-op bullet hell arcade game.

Unfortunately, the actual program files were lost, so this project currently only contains the .exe and the data files that go along with it.
To play this game, you need to plug in two Xbox controllers.

I'm in the works of recreating this game, so contact me if you want more info.
